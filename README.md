# Weather Dashboard

This is a handy weather dashboard that will show you the weather of the city you select in the search bar.

The live site can be found here:

If you have never used the dashboard before, you will be automatically redirected to the home splash screen.

Once a city is entered, and it is a valid city (some obscenities are surprisingly valid cities...) you will be presented with the current weather conditions as well as a 5-day forecast.

When you return to this page again, it will show you the last searched city on the dashboard, as well as your 10 most recent searches in the left-hand sidebar. Click on any of these options to have the weather refreshed for that location.
